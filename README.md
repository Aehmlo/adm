# `adm`

Short for "Alex's Device Manager," `adm` is a set of tools for smart home automation.

Currently, only LIFX bulbs are supported, and only the CLI is useful, but this will change as my own needs evolve.

If you'd like to see support added for another device type, feel free to [file an issue](https://github.com/Aehmlo/adm/issues/new) or [open a pull request](https://github.com/Aehmlo/adm/compare)!
